AI_training_with_10_projects
This repository contains ten practical AI and data science projects, each designed to help you learn, experiment, and build real-world skills in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and data management. Each project is self-contained and organized for clarity, with code ready for exploration and extension.

Project List
INVENTORY_SYSTEM
Python-based inventory management system for tracking and visualizing shoe inventory.

SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
Sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning and NLP techniques.

CNN_IMAGE
Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.

TRAIN_GAN_AND_DCGAN(MINI_IMAGE_AI)
Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGAN) for image generation.

TRAIN_CGAN(Pet_image_detector)
Conditional GAN for pet image detection and generation.

Explore_varoious_text_embedding techniques
Exploration of various text embedding methods for NLP, including word2vec, GloVe, and transformer-based embeddings.

fine_tune_gpt-2_on_small_datasets
Fine-tuning GPT-2 on small custom datasets for personalized text generation.

SIZE(<=5GB)MODELS_WITH_OLLAMA_PROJECTS
Experiments with small AI models and integration with Ollama for efficient model management.

Implement_RAG_SYSTEM
Implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot system combining information retrieval and generative AI.

TALK_TO_DATABASE
Python scripts and utilities for interacting with databases, covering CRUD operations and data management.

Repository Structure
Each project is in its own folder, with code, scripts, and documentation.
Large datasets, trained models, generated outputs, and environment files are excluded from version control (see .gitignore).
Only code and essential documentation are tracked, making the repository clean and easy to use.
Getting Started
Clone the repository and explore each project folder. Follow the instructions in each project’s documentation or scripts to run and experiment with the code.
